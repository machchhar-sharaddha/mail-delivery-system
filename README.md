# Network-Graphs-OO-design
part of the system is only concerned with determining a “best” route for the van to take, given the knowledge your program has about (some of) the campus buildings and the roads around them. At this point we’re designing and testing a prototype, so it thankfully doesn’t need the entire campus map and roads yet.

## Packages needed for running
tabulate (for pretty printing), 
pandas, 
networkx

## Run client.py
